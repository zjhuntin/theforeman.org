    "### Puppet 4 Integration with Katello\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently Foreman has grown to work with Puppet 4. Katello is following suite and will soon be ready to use Puppet 4. In this post we will explain how to create new Katello environments Puppet 4 ready, and upgrade exisiting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important things to know about environments with Katello and Puppet 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet 4 uses a Java Virtual Machine and requires more memory than Puppet 3 had before. This means that systems acting as Katello servers with Puppet 4 need a larger amount of memory. At a minimum we are requiring 8 GB of memory, and reccomending 16GB (<-- need a fact check on this). \n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet 4 masters can still provision computers with Puppet 3 with [some configuration](https://docs.puppet.com/puppetserver/latest/compatibility_with_puppet_agent.html). This can help with systems that are migrating over to Puppet 4. You can start with upgrading your masters to Puppet 4 and then gradually upgrading you agents.\n",

    "### How to install Katello with Puppet 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production Environments\n",
    "If you wanted to create a new Katello server configured with Puppet 4 the easiest way to do this would be to spin up a Virtual Machine with [Forklift](https://github.com/Katello/forklift).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you can follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/katello/forklift.git\n",
    "cd forklift\n",
    "vagrant up centos7-katello-p4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will setup a virtual environment with Katello and Puppet 4 enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Devlopment environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are so inclined you can create a development environment of Katello using Puppet 4. To do this you can spin it up (also with Forklift) as a virtual machine with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "example-dev-p4:\n",
    "  box: centos7\n",
    "  memory: 9000\n",
    "  shell: 'yum -y install ruby && cd /vagrant && ./setup.rb'\n",
    "  options: --scenario=katello-devel --puppet-four\n",
    "  installer: --katello-devel-github-username <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME> --disable-system-checks\n",
    "  ansible:\n",
    "    group: 'server'\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Note this setup does require that you have a fork of Katello setup on your github account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `vagrant up example-dev-p4` and let it spin up the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this you'll have to do a couple things to get it running.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Capsules\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if you wanted to create a capsule with Forklift you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In your boxes.yml file you can write\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "example-capsule-p4:\n",
    "  box: centos7\n",
    "  ansible:\n",
    "    playbook: 'playbooks/capsule-dev.yml'\n",
    "    options: --puppet-four\n",
    "    group: 'capsule'\n",
    "    server: 'example-katello-p4'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* After run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant up example-capsule-p4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once it completes installing\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details on how to upgrade both Katello servers, capsules, and hosts to use puppet 4\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a [great video](https://youtu.be/GFNPHypFhl4?t=2545) and [excellent documentation](http://www.katello.org/docs/nightly/upgrade/puppet.html) on how to upgrade from Puppet 3 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To upgrade an exisisting Katello instance to Puppet 4 it is straight forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting backup or take snapshot the Katello server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "katello-service stop # This will stop all services.\n",
    "foreman-installer --upgrade-puppet # This performs the upgrade.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The --upgrade-puppet command will restart the services, but you can make sure they are running with `hammer ping`. If you run puppet --version on the server, it should show `4.6.0` or a smilar \n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributors\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to thank everyone on the Katello team for putting in the effort for making this happen. As well as Foreman, the community  that puts so much effort into these great projects!\n",
