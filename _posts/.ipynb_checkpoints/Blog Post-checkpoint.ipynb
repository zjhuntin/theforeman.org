    "### Puppet 4 Integration with Katello\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently Foreman has grown to work with Puppet 4. Katello is following suite and will soon be ready to use Puppet 4. In this post we will explain how to create new Katello environments Puppet 4 ready, and upgrade exisiting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important things to know about environments with Katello and Puppet 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet 4 uses a Java Virtual Machine and requires more memory than Puppet 3 had before. This means that systems acting as Katello servers with Puppet 4 need a larger amount of memory. At a minimum we are requiring 8 GB of memory, and reccomending 16GB (<-- need a fact check on this). \n",
    "\n",
    "Puppet 4 masters can still provision computers with Puppet 3 with [some configuration](https://docs.puppet.com/puppetserver/latest/compatibility_with_puppet_agent.html). This can help with systems that are migrating over to Puppet 4. You can start with upgrading your masters to Puppet 4 and then gradually upgrading you agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this matrix as a quick reference of what can work with what:\n",

    "### How to install Katello with Puppet 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production Environments\n",
    "If you wanted to create a new Katello server configured with Puppet 4 the easiest way to do this would be to spin up a Virtual Machine with [Forklift](https://github.com/Katello/forklift).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you can follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/katello/forklift.git\n",
    "cd forklift\n",
    "vagrant up centos7-katello-p4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if you want to bring up a capsule quickly you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant up centos8-capsule-p4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is done you'll have a configured capsule to go along with your Katello server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upgrade Production Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an existing environment that you need to update we have several guides to help. There is a [great video](https://youtu.be/GFNPHypFhl4?t=2545) and [excellent documentation](http://www.katello.org/docs/nightly/upgrade/puppet.html) on how to upgrade from Puppet 3 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also follow these instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting backup or take snapshot the Katello server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "katello-service stop # This will stop all services.\n",
    "foreman-installer --upgrade-puppet # This performs the upgrade.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The --upgrade-puppet command will restart the services, but you can make sure they are running with `hammer ping`. If you run puppet --version on the server, it should show `4.6.0` or a smilar \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Development environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are so inclined you can create a development environment of Katello using Puppet 4. To do this you can spin it up (also with Forklift) as a virtual machine with the following configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "example-dev-p4:\n",
    "  box: centos7\n",
    "  memory: 9000\n",
    "  shell: 'yum -y install ruby && cd /vagrant && ./setup.rb'\n",
    "  options: --scenario=katello-devel --puppet-four\n",
    "  installer: --katello-devel-github-username <YOUR GITHUB USERNAME> --disable-system-checks\n",
    "  ansible:\n",
    "    group: 'server'\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Note this setup does require that you have a fork of Katello setup on your github account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `vagrant up example-dev-p4` and let it spin up the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extra configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently we added a webpack to foreman allowing new forms of Javascript to be used with our frontend. To get this working properly there are a few extra steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant ssh example-dev-p4\n",
    "cd foreman\n",
    "sudo yum install npm\n",
    "npm install\n",
    "rails s\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like you can also disable the webpack after doing the steps above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the development config file in foreman under `config/environments/development.conf` you'll this setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```php\n",
    "config.webpack.dev_server.enabled = false # Replace the setting to false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rake webpack:compile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With that you'll be able to run your dev server without having to do anything else with webpack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Capsules\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if you wanted to create a capsule with Forklift you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In your boxes.yml file you can write\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "example-capsule-p4:\n",
    "  box: centos7\n",
    "  ansible:\n",
    "    playbook: 'playbooks/capsule-dev.yml'\n",
    "    options: --puppet-four\n",
    "    group: 'capsule'\n",
    "    server: '<name of your katello box>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* After run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vagrant up example-capsule-p4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributors\n",
